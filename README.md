# -Real-Time-Object-Detection-YOLOv7-
This project implements a real time object detection via video, webcam and image detection using YOLO algorithm.
YOLOv7 advances in object detection by inferring more quickly and accurately than its contemporaries. 
In the range of 5 FPS to 160 FPS, YOLOv7 outperforms all existing object detectors in terms of both speed and accuracy, and on GPU V100, 
it has the greatest accuracy of 56.8% AP of all real-time object detectors with 30 FPS or more.

Moreover, we train YOLOv7 only on **MS COCO dataset** from scratch without using any other datasets or pre-trained weights. 
Video analytics, robotics, autonomous vehicles, multi-object tracking and object counting, medical image analysis, and other applications use real-time object detection models.
